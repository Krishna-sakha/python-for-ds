# 🌟 Always Remember 🌟
# If you don’t understand anything at first, it’s completely okay!
# Feel free to Google it or watch a small YouTube tutorial on that specific topic.
# Just don’t get stuck in "tutorial hell" — the goal is to learn and keep moving forward.
# We’re here to grow step by step, and our real competition is only with our *past self* 💪

# What is Python?

# Python is a computer programming language which is used to communicate 
# between humans and computers 🧠💻

# It’s similar to English language and very beginner-friendly.
# Today we gonna learn how to "talk" to our computer for the first time.

# Let’s print our first line!

print("hello world")

# Explanation:
# To talk in Python language, we have to tell our computer: 
# print → which means “do this task”
# and then we write our task inside quotes ("") 

# So easy right? hehe 😄 
# Don’t stress much — it’s as easy as this!

# Try writing your own line 👇
print("i m the most intelligent creature")

# You can write anything inside those quotes — your computer will say it back!
